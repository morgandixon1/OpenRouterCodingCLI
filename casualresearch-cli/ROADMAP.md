# Casual Research CLI Roadmap

The [Official Casual Research CLI Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/google-casualresearch/projects/11/)

Casual Research CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings the power of casualresearch directly into your terminal. It provides lightweight access to casualresearch, giving you the most direct path from your prompt to our model.

This document outlines our approach to the Casual Research CLI roadmap. Here, you'll find our guiding principles and a breakdown of the key areas we are

## Our Guiding Principles

As an [Apache 2.0 open source project](https://github.com/google-casualresearch/casual-research-cli?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme), we appreciate and welcome [public contributions](https://github.com/google-casualresearch/casual-research-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and will give first priority to those contributions aligned with our roadmap. If you want to propose a new feature or change to our roadmap, please start by [opening an issue for discussion](https://github.com/google-casualresearch/casual-research-cli/issues/new/choose).

## Our Vision

- **Power & Simplicity:** Deliver access to state-of-the-art casualresearch models with an intuitive and easy-to-use lightweight command-line interface.

- **Intelligent:** Casual Research CLI should be reliably ranked among the best agentic tools as measured by benchmarks like SWE Bench, Terminal Bench, and CSAT.

## Roadmap Management

Our roadmap is managed directly through Github Issues. See our entry point Roadmap Issue [here](https://github.com/google-casualresearch/casual-research-cli/issues/4191). This approach allows for transparency and gives you a direct way to learn more or get involved with any specific initiative. All our roadmap items will be tagged as Type:`Feat

## Key Areas of Focus

To see what we're working on, you can filter our issues by these dimensions. See all our items [here](https://github.com/orgs/google-casualresearch/projects/11/views/19)

### Core Platform

- **Authentication:** Secure user access via API keys, casualresearch Code Assist login etc.
- **Model:** Support new casualresearch models, multi-modality, local execution, and performance tuning.

### Extensibility

- **Extensibility:** Bringing Casual Research CLI to other surfaces e.g. GitHub.

## Contributing

Casual Research CLI is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community!
